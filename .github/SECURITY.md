## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it as soon as possible. Please email us at [security@yourproject.org](mailto:security@yourproject.org) with a detailed description of the issue and any relevant proof of concept. We are committed to addressing all security concerns promptly.

## Security Measures

- **Dependency Management**: Our project uses `requirements.txt` and `setup.py` for dependency management. We regularly review and update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities, adhering to best practices in dependency hygiene.

- **Handling of Secrets**: The codebase does not contain hardcoded secrets such as passwords, API keys, or tokens. We recommend that all contributors use environment variables or secure configuration management tools to handle sensitive information.

- **Secure Coding Practices**: We follow custom coding standards, including **CEP-8** for Python and **CEP-5** for Bash scripts, to ensure code quality and security. These standards emphasize input validation, error handling, and adherence to the principle of least privilege.

- **Encryption and Cryptography**: While the current codebase does not implement encryption or decryption functionalities, any future cryptographic implementations will utilize well-vetted libraries and follow industry-standard algorithms to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: References to authentication mechanisms are minimal. Any future integration of authentication features will be designed with robust security protocols and regular audits.

## Code Scanning and Continuous Integration

We employ tools such as `flake8`, `pytest`, and `tox` for continuous integration and static code analysis. These tools help us identify potential security issues early in the development process.

## Security Updates

We are committed to promptly updating the project to address any security vulnerabilities. Users are encouraged to keep their versions up to date to benefit from the latest security enhancements.

## Third-Party Dependencies

All third-party libraries and dependencies are sourced from trusted repositories. We closely monitor these dependencies for any reported vulnerabilities and apply patches as necessary.

## Contact Information
